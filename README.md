# C02-Emissions


## INTRODUCTION TO THE DATASET:

We found our dataset on Kaggle, however the origin of the data is from the Canadian Government official open data website. Since the data originates from a government institution, we believe that the data is reliable. The data contains 7385 observations of vehicles from a period of 7 years, 6282 of them being unique. There are 12 columns that describe certain features of the car, statistics of the fuel, and CO2 emissions.

## ANALYSIS GOAL:

The goal of our analysis is to determine which factors of a car, such as fuel consumption, the amount of cylinders, fuel type, and engine size, are best at modeling the amount of correlation to the CO2 emission of each car.
